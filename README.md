# Crime Busters Online Web based Application Upgrade
This is an upgrade of code I developed to show maps of crimes reported to police. This was used in local news paper website.

**Note: the code is no longer in use, and the crime accusations are old.**

Back in the day, we worked with Queensland Police to send daily reports, In another stand alone application, I created `.xml` files based on dates of reports. 

This application was used to show reported events as markers using Google Maps API.

> A first in Australia!

## Notes
I created this to outline my skills, ability to upgrade old code without original source:

* Complete rewrite of old code.
* I un-obfuscated my original code downloaded from Wayback Machine.
* Upgrading to latest version of Google Maps API.
* Upgraded to use HTML5/ES6 Modules.
* Uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points on the Earthâ€™s surface, sorts events listed, based on distance from map center. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula

**No external JavaScript frameworks such as Angular or React where used.**

### Old Code Written by myself in 2010
<https://web.archive.org/web/20120224161647/http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/crimebusters/>

I used multiple resources to find and download the HTML and related `.css`, `.js` as well as related images.

Ended up directly downloading the code, removing Wayback Machine code and links:

## Upgrade Notes:

### Error with outdated version:

From Edge DevTools Console:

> Google Maps JavaScript API has been loaded directly without loading=async. 
This can result in suboptimal performance. For best-practice loading patterns please see https://goo.gle/js-api-loading 

Code was using:
```HTML
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key="" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
### I tried other ways to download old souce code:
First using different ways, but ended up simply downloading manually.

#### Bash Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
url= "http://www.townsvillebulletin.com.au/crimebusters/" 
wget "http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=${url}*&output=json&fl=original,timestamp" -O out.json
sed -Eni '2,$s%^\["([^"]*)","([^"]*)"](,|])$%https://web.archive.org/web/\2id_/\1%gmp' out.json 
wget -i out.json
```
### Wayback Machine Downloader

## Examples:
### IFRAME

This was the application, using an `<IFRAME>` running on web browser:

![Wayback Machine](examples/website.png)

The `<IFRAME>` source. Not all images downloaded and Google Maps outdated:

Running on Android mobile phone, in full screen:
